TreeSet is sorted by natural order of elements in java.
In program 1 we used elements of Integer type, Integer class implements Comparable interface and overrides its compareTo() method. 
But, for using Employee as elements we it must implement Comparable interface and override its compareTo() method.

 Note : If we Employee donï¿½t implement Comparable interface and override its compareTo() method than ClassCastException (RunTimeException) will be thrown. Because, internally TreeSet uses TreeMap for storing elements and TreeMap calls compare method for comparing elements, 
 while comparing elements casting to java.lang.Comparable will fail at runtime.
