 * TreeMap is sorted by natural order of keys in java.
In program 3 we used Integer as key, Integer class implements Comparable interface and overrides its compareTo() method. 
But, for using Employee as key we it must implement Comparable interface and override its compareTo() method in java.

 Note : If we Employee donï¿½t implement Comparable interface and override its compareTo() method than ClassCastException (RunTimeException) will be thrown. Because, internally TreeMap calls compare method for comparing keys , while comparing keys casting to java.lang.Comparable will fail at runtime.*/
